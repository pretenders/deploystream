CUSTOMISE BOOTSTRAP
===================

Install twitter bower and recess as npm modules, within the virtualenv:
(bower for dependency management, and recess for LESS compilation)

$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g recess
...both done by ./scripts/nodereqs.py


Install bootstrap as a bower component:

$ bower install bootstrap#2.3.1
...this will create a folder components/bootstrap


INITIAL STEPS TO USE BOOTSTRAP AS A BASE
========================================

Make bootstrap files usable in our project:

Symlink components/bootstrap/less to deploystream/static/less/bootstrap

Copy bootstrap.less into site.less, and copy variables.less
Comment-out unneeded components and adjust import paths to point
to bootstrap/*.less


DAILY WORK ON STYLES
====================

Edit only LESS files in static/less.

Compile with:

$ recess site.less --compile [--compress] > ../css/site.css
...or just use static/compile-css.sh

(compile other less files if they need to be standalone CSS, else
import from site)


DYNAMIC WORKFLOW
================

In order to compile css dynamically as you work with the less files:

$ cd deploystream/static
$ recess less/site.less:css/site.css --watch less/
...or just use static/watch-less.sh
